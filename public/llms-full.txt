## Company Overview

TheGrantScout is a grant matching service designed specifically for nonprofits seeking foundation funding. Unlike traditional grant databases that provide raw data access, TheGrantScout delivers curated, actionable intelligence about which foundations are most likely to fund a specific organization based on their historical giving patterns.

### Core Value Proposition

"Your mission deserves funding. We'll help you find it."

TheGrantScout solves the problem of grant research being time-consuming and often ineffective. Many nonprofits spend weeks researching foundations only to discover they've been approaching funders who don't actually fund their type of work, geography, or budget size.

### Target Customers

- Small to mid-sized nonprofits ($250K - $5M annual budget)
- Development directors and grant managers
- Executive directors at organizations without dedicated grant staff
- Nonprofit consultants serving multiple clients

## How It Works

### Step 1: Client Onboarding

During a 30-minute onboarding call, we collect:
- Organization mission and programs
- Geographic service area (local, state, regional, national)
- Annual operating budget
- Populations served (demographics, issue areas)
- Current funding sources (to exclude from results)
- Funding goals and priorities

### Step 2: AI Analysis

Our algorithm analyzes the client profile against 8.3M+ historical grants from IRS 990-PF filings. The matching process considers:
- **Geographic alignment**: Does the foundation fund in the client's service area?
- **Sector alignment**: Does the foundation fund the client's NTEE sector?
- **Budget fit**: Is the client's budget size consistent with the foundation's typical recipients?
- **Mission similarity**: Does the foundation's giving history suggest interest in similar work?
- **Giving capacity**: Does the foundation have assets and giving volume to be a meaningful funder?

### Step 3: Report Delivery

Within 48 hours of onboarding, clients receive their first monthly report via email (PDF format).

### Step 4: Monthly Updates

Each month, clients receive a new report with fresh opportunities, updated funder intelligence, and tracking of previously identified prospects.

## Data Sources and Methodology

### Primary Data Source: IRS Form 990-PF

All foundation data comes from IRS Form 990-PF, the annual tax return filed by private foundations. This form is a public record and contains:

- Every grant made by the foundation (recipient name, amount, purpose)
- Foundation assets and financial information
- Officers and directors
- Application information

### Data Coverage

- **Foundations**: 143,000+ private foundations
- **Grants**: 8.3M+ individual grant records
- **Years**: 2016-2024 (8 years of giving data)
- **Update frequency**: Annual (typically Q2-Q3 as IRS releases new filings)

### Data Quality

- Data is extracted directly from IRS XML filings
- Recipient names are normalized and deduplicated
- Geographic data is standardized to state/city
- Grant purposes are categorized by NTEE codes

### Matching Algorithm

Our matching algorithm uses multiple signals:

1. **State match percentage**: What percent of a foundation's grants go to the client's state?
2. **Sector match percentage**: What percent goes to the client's NTEE sector?
3. **Budget compatibility**: Is the client's budget similar to the foundation's typical recipients?
4. **Geographic concentration**: How focused is the foundation (local vs. national)?
5. **Giving activity**: Is the foundation actively making grants?
6. **Openness to applications**: Does the foundation indicate it accepts applications?

Foundations are scored and ranked by overall fit, with the highest-scoring matches included in the monthly report.

## Glossary of Terms

### 990-PF Form
The IRS Form 990-PF is an annual information return filed by private foundations. It includes detailed financial information and a complete list of all grants made during the tax year. This is the primary data source for TheGrantScout.

### Grant Matching
Grant matching is the process of identifying foundations whose giving history, priorities, and criteria align with a nonprofit's mission, programs, and characteristics. The goal is to find funders likely to be interested in supporting the organization.

### Private Foundation
A private foundation is a nonprofit organization that typically receives its funding from a single source (such as an individual, family, or corporation) and makes grants to other organizations. Private foundations must file Form 990-PF annually with the IRS.

### Operating Foundation
An operating foundation is a type of private foundation that primarily conducts its own charitable programs rather than making grants to other organizations. Operating foundations still file Form 990-PF but have different distribution requirements.

### Community Foundation
A community foundation is a public charity that pools donations from many sources to support a specific geographic community. Community foundations file Form 990 (not 990-PF) and are not included in TheGrantScout's database.

### Letter of Inquiry (LOI)
A Letter of Inquiry is a brief document (1-3 pages) sent to a foundation to introduce your organization and proposed project before submitting a full grant proposal. Many foundations require or prefer an LOI before accepting applications.

### NTEE Codes
The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) is a classification system for nonprofit organizations. NTEE codes categorize nonprofits by their primary purpose (e.g., A = Arts, B = Education, P = Human Services). TheGrantScout uses NTEE codes to match nonprofits with foundations funding similar sectors.

### General Operating Support
A general operating support grant (also called unrestricted funding) can be used for any organizational purpose, including salaries, rent, and overhead. This is in contrast to program-specific or restricted grants.

### Program-Specific Grant
A program-specific grant (also called restricted funding) is designated for a particular program, project, or purpose and cannot be used for general operations.

### Grant Prospecting
Grant prospecting is the process of identifying and researching potential foundation funders. This is distinct from grant writing, which is the process of preparing and submitting applications.

### Funder Intelligence
Funder intelligence refers to detailed information about a foundation's giving patterns, preferences, and decision-making criteria. This goes beyond basic data to include analysis of who they fund, how much they give, and what they prioritize.
